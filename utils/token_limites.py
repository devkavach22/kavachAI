Abstract
We study the capabilities of speech processing
systems trained simply to predict large amounts of
transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled
to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30

Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.

In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.
These two benchmarks are somewhat narrow since they
only include 15 unique languages, almost all of which are in

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

Table 5. Language identification performance. Zero-shot Whisper’s accuracy at language identification is not competitive with
prior supervised results on Fleurs. This is partially due to Whisper
being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

Figure 7. Whisper’s performance is close to that of professional

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.

C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models

a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies
2
If an acronym or basis for the name is desired, WSPSR standing for Web-scale Supervised Pretraining for Speech Recognition
can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.
Whisper performs well on Multilingual LibriSpeech, outperforming XLS-R (Babu et al., 2021), mSLAM (Bapna

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.
These two benchmarks are somewhat narrow since they

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

We study the capabilities of speech processing
systems trained simply to predict large amounts of
transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled
to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.
Whisper performs well on Multilingual LibriSpeech, outperforming XLS-R (Babu et al., 2021), mSLAM (Bapna

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.
These two benchmarks are somewhat narrow since they
only include 15 unique languages, almost all of which are in

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

Table 5. Language identification performance. Zero-shot Whisper’s accuracy at language identification is not competitive with
prior supervised results on Fleurs. This is partially due to Whisper
being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

English speech recognition performance refers to an average over
12 datasets while the Multilingual speech recognition reports performance on the overlapping subset of languages in Fleurs and
X→en translation reports average BLEU on CoVoST2. Dataset
size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

scale. For small models, performance on English speech recognition degrades when trained jointly in a multitask and multilingual
setup. However, multilingual and multitask models benefit more
from scale and eventually outperform models trained on English
data only. 95% bootstrap estimate confidence intervals are shown.
models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

using our text normalizer generally results in lower WERs than

and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 21
C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies
2
If an acronym or basis for the name is desired, WSPSR standing for Web-scale Supervised Pretraining for Speech Recognition
can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but

3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30

A model with high effective robustness does better than

ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.
Whisper performs well on Multilingual LibriSpeech, outperforming XLS-R (Babu et al., 2021), mSLAM (Bapna

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.
These two benchmarks are somewhat narrow since they
only include 15 unique languages, almost all of which are in

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

Table 5. Language identification performance. Zero-shot Whisper’s accuracy at language identification is not competitive with
prior supervised results on Fleurs. This is partially due to Whisper
being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

Figure 7. Whisper’s performance is close to that of professional

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

English speech recognition performance refers to an average over
12 datasets while the Multilingual speech recognition reports performance on the overlapping subset of languages in Fleurs and
X→en translation reports average BLEU on CoVoST2. Dataset
size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.

C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies
2
If an acronym or basis for the name is desired, WSPSR standing for Web-scale Supervised Pretraining for Speech Recognition
can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in

In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled
to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.

held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error

A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models

LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

Figure 7. Whisper’s performance is close to that of professional

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

using our text normalizer generally results in lower WERs than

and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.

C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies
2
If an acronym or basis for the name is desired, WSPSR standing for Web-scale Supervised Pretraining for Speech Recognition
can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.

to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

Table 5. Language identification performance. Zero-shot Whisper’s accuracy at language identification is not competitive with
prior supervised results on Fleurs. This is partially due to Whisper
being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

indicating the WERs on individual recordings, and the aggregate

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).

A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)

C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1

process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies
2

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.

1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/

2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

indicating the WERs on individual recordings, and the aggregate

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

English speech recognition performance refers to an average over
12 datasets while the Multilingual speech recognition reports performance on the overlapping subset of languages in Fleurs and

size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset

A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)

C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at

2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.

Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.

In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:

VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.

3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 10
as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

Figure 7. Whisper’s performance is close to that of professional

25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset transcribed by Whisper,

transcription services (F-I). The box plot is superimposed with dots
indicating the WERs on individual recordings, and the aggregate

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 21
C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated

trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition

speech recognition, we release inference code and models at

2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.

systems trained simply to predict large amounts of
transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled
to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

Figure 7. Whisper’s performance is close to that of professional
human transcribers. This plot shows the WER distributions of
25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset transcribed by Whisper,

computer-assisted human transcription service (E) and 4 human
transcription services (F-I). The box plot is superimposed with dots
indicating the WERs on individual recordings, and the aggregate

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 21
C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at

2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.

We study the capabilities of speech processing
systems trained simply to predict large amounts of
transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled
to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.

cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.

model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.
These two benchmarks are somewhat narrow since they

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

Figure 7. Whisper’s performance is close to that of professional
human transcribers. This plot shows the WER distributions of
25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset transcribed by Whisper,

transcription services (F-I). The box plot is superimposed with dots

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 21
C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.

We study the capabilities of speech processing
systems trained simply to predict large amounts of
transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled
to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training

data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely

Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities

and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.
These two benchmarks are somewhat narrow since they
only include 15 unique languages, almost all of which are in

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

Table 5. Language identification performance. Zero-shot Whisper’s accuracy at language identification is not competitive with
prior supervised results on Fleurs. This is partially due to Whisper
being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

English speech recognition performance refers to an average over

size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 21
C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

If an acronym or basis for the name is desired, WSPSR standing for Web-scale Supervised Pretraining for Speech Recognition
can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.

We study the capabilities of speech processing
systems trained simply to predict large amounts of
transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled
to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.

the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice

a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also

the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context

dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30

Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.

include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.
These two benchmarks are somewhat narrow since they
only include 15 unique languages, almost all of which are in

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

Table 5. Language identification performance. Zero-shot Whisper’s accuracy at language identification is not competitive with
prior supervised results on Fleurs. This is partially due to Whisper
being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

Table 6. Performance improves with increasing dataset size.
English speech recognition performance refers to an average over
12 datasets while the Multilingual speech recognition reports performance on the overlapping subset of languages in Fleurs and
X→en translation reports average BLEU on CoVoST2. Dataset
size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 21
C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies
2
If an acronym or basis for the name is desired, WSPSR standing for Web-scale Supervised Pretraining for Speech Recognition
can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30

Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,

include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its

We study the capabilities of speech processing
systems trained simply to predict large amounts of
transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled
to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.
Whisper performs well on Multilingual LibriSpeech, outperforming XLS-R (Babu et al., 2021), mSLAM (Bapna

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.
These two benchmarks are somewhat narrow since they
only include 15 unique languages, almost all of which are in

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

Table 5. Language identification performance. Zero-shot Whisper’s accuracy at language identification is not competitive with
prior supervised results on Fleurs. This is partially due to Whisper
being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

English speech recognition performance refers to an average over
12 datasets while the Multilingual speech recognition reports performance on the overlapping subset of languages in Fleurs and
X→en translation reports average BLEU on CoVoST2. Dataset
size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 21
C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies
2
If an acronym or basis for the name is desired, WSPSR standing for Web-scale Supervised Pretraining for Speech Recognition
can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30

3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its

We study the capabilities of speech processing
systems trained simply to predict large amounts of
transcripts of audio on the internet. When scaled
to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 2. Zero-shot Whisper models close the gap to human
robustness. Despite matching or outperforming a human on LibriSpeech dev-clean, supervised LibriSpeech models make roughly
twice as many errors as a human on other datasets demonstrating
their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the reference dataset and approaches the
ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models
have very different robustness properties than supervised
LibriSpeech models and out-perform all benchmarked LibriSpeech models by large amounts on other datasets. Even

the smallest zero-shot Whisper model, which has only 39
million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.
Whisper performs well on Multilingual LibriSpeech, outperforming XLS-R (Babu et al., 2021), mSLAM (Bapna

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.
These two benchmarks are somewhat narrow since they
only include 15 unique languages, almost all of which are in

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

Table 5. Language identification performance. Zero-shot Whisper’s accuracy at language identification is not competitive with
prior supervised results on Fleurs. This is partially due to Whisper
being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

Figure 7. Whisper’s performance is close to that of professional

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

English speech recognition performance refers to an average over
12 datasets while the Multilingual speech recognition reports performance on the overlapping subset of languages in Fleurs and
X→en translation reports average BLEU on CoVoST2. Dataset
size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

open-source models, compared to FairSpeech’s normalizer. For
each dataset, the boxplot shows the distribution of relative WER
reduction across different models in our eval suite, showing that
using our text normalizer generally results in lower WERs than
FairSpeech’s. On a few datasets our normalizer reduces WER
significantly and more so for Whisper models, such as CallHome
and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 21
C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

to 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask
supervision, the resulting models generalize well
to standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies

can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30

Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the

A model with high effective robustness does better than

ideal of equal performance on all datasets. For our analysis, we use LibriSpeech as the reference dataset due to its
central role in modern speech recognition research and the
availability of many released models trained on it, which
allows for characterizing robustness behaviors. We use a
suite of 12 other academic speech recognition datasets to
study out-of-distribution behaviors. Full details about these
datasets can be found in Appendix A.
Our main findings are summarized in Figure 2 and Table 2.
Although the best zero-shot Whisper model has a relatively
unremarkable LibriSpeech clean-test WER of 2.5, which
is roughly the performance of modern supervised baseline
or the mid-2019 state of the art, zero-shot Whisper models

million parameters and a 6.7 WER on LibriSpeech test-clean
is roughly competitive with the best supervised LibriSpeech
model when evaluated on other datasets. When compared
to a human in Figure 2, the best zero-shot Whisper models
roughly match their accuracy and robustness. For a detailed
breakdown of this large improvement in robustness, Table
2 compares the performance of the best zero-shot Whisper
model with a supervised LibriSpeech model that has the
closest performance to it on LibriSpeech test-clean. Despite
their very close performance on the reference distribution,
the zero-shot Whisper model achieves an average relative
error reduction of 55.2% when evaluated on other speech
recognition datasets.
This finding suggests emphasizing zero-shot and out-ofdistribution evaluations of models, particularly when attempting to compare to human performance, to avoid overstating the capabilities of machine learning systems due to
misleading comparisons.
3.4. Multi-lingual Speech Recognition
In order to compare to prior work on multilingual speech
recognition, we report results on two low-data benchmarks:
Multilingual LibriSpeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020b) and
VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021) in Table 3.
Whisper performs well on Multilingual LibriSpeech, outperforming XLS-R (Babu et al., 2021), mSLAM (Bapna

setting. We caution that we do use a simple text standardizer
for this result which prevents direct comparison or claims
of SOTA performance. On VoxPopuli, however, Whisper
significantly underperforms prior work and only beats the
VP-10K+FT baseline from the original paper. We suspect
the underperformance of Whisper models on VoxPopuli
could be due to other models including this distribution as
a major source for their unsupervised pre-training data and
the dataset having significantly more supervised data, which
benefits fine-tuning. While MLS has 10 hours of training
data per language, the average amount of training data per
language is roughly 10× higher for VoxPopuli.
These two benchmarks are somewhat narrow since they
only include 15 unique languages, almost all of which are in

the Indo-European language family and many of which are
high-resource languages. These benchmarks only provide
limited coverage and room to study Whisper models multilingual capabilities which include training data for speech
recognition in 75 languages. To study the performance of
Whisper more broadly we also report performance on the
Fleurs dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). In particular, we were
interested in studying the relationship between the amount
of training data we have for a given language and the resulting downstream zero-shot performance for that language.
We visualize this relation in Figure 3. We find a strong
squared correlation coefficient of 0.83 between the log of
the word error rate and the log of the amount of training
data per language. Checking the regression coefficient for a
linear fit to these log-log values results in an estimate that
WER halves for every 16× increase in training data. We
also observed that many of the largest outliers in terms of
worse than expected performance according to this trend are
languages that have unique scripts and are more distantly
related to the Indo-European languages making up the majority of the training dataset such as Hebrew (HE), Telugu
(TE), Chinese (ZH), and Korean (KO). These differences
could be due to a lack of transfer due to linguistic distance,
our byte level BPE tokenizer being a poor match for these
languages, or variations in data quality.

prior supervised results on Fleurs. This is partially due to Whisper
being heavily penalized for having no training data for 20 of Fleurs
languages.
3.5. Translation
We study the translation capabilities of Whisper models
by measuring their performance on the X→en subset of
CoVoST2 (Wang et al., 2020b). We compare with Maestro,
mSLAM, and XLS-R, the highest-performing prior work.
We achieve a new state of the art of 29.1 BLEU zero-shot
without using any of the CoVoST2 training data. We attribute this to the 68,000 hours of X→en translation data
for these languages in our pre-training dataset which, although noisy, is vastly larger than the 861 hours of training
data for X→en translation in CoVoST2. Since Whisper evaluation is zero-shot, it does particularly well on the lowest
resource grouping of CoVoST2, improving over mSLAM
by 6.7 BLEU. Conversely, the best Whisper model does not
actually improve over Maestro and mSLAM on average for
the highest resource languages.
For an additional analysis on an even wider set of languages,
we also re-purpose Fleurs, which is a speech recognition
dataset, as a translation dataset. Since the same sentences
are transcribed for every language we use the English transcripts as reference translations. In Figure 4 we visualize
the correlation between the amount of translation training
data per language and the resulting zero-shot BLEU score
on Fleurs. While there is a clear trend of improvement with
increasing training data, the squared correlation coefficient
is much lower than the 0.83 observed for speech recognition

and only 0.24. We suspect this is partly caused by the noisier
training data due to errors in audio language identification.
As an example, Welsh (CY) is an outlier with much worse
than expected performance at only 13 BLEU despite supposedly having 9,000 hours of translation data. This large
amount of Welsh translation data is surprising, ranking 4th
overall for translation data and ahead of some of the most
spoken languages in the world like French, Spanish, and
Russian. Inspection shows the majority of supposedly Welsh
translation data is actually English audio with English captions where the English audio was mis-classified as Welsh
by the language identification system, resulting in it being
included as translation training data rather transcription data
according to our dataset creation rules.
3.6. Language Identification
To evaluate language identification, we use the Fleurs
dataset (Conneau et al., 2022). The zero-shot performance
of Whisper is not competitive with prior supervised work
here and underperforms the supervised SOTA by 13.6%.
However, Whisper is heavily disadvantaged for language
identification on Fleurs, since the Whisper dataset contains
no training data for 20 of the 102 languages in Fleurs, upperbounding accuracy at 80.4%. On the 82 overlapping languages the best Whisper model achieves 80.3% accuracy.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 9
3.7. Robustness to Additive Noise
We tested the noise robustness of Whisper models and 14
LibriSpeech-trained models by measuring the WER when
either white noise or pub noise from the Audio Degradation Toolbox (Mauch & Ewert, 2013) was added to the
audio. The pub noise represents a more natural noisy environment with ambient noise and indistinct chatter typical
in a crowded restaurant or a pub. Among the 14 models,
twelve are pre-trained and/or fine-tuned on LibriSpeech, and
the other two are NVIDIA STT models trained on a mixture
dataset similar to prior work like SpeechStew that includes
LibriSpeech. The level of additive noise corresponding to
a given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated based on
the signal power of individual examples. Figure 5 shows
how the ASR performance degrades as the additive noise
becomes more intensive. There are many models that outperform our zero-shot performance under low noise (40 dB
SNR), which is unsurprising given those models are trained
primarily on LibriSpeech, but all models quickly degrade as
the noise becomes more intensive, performing worse than
the Whisper model under additive pub noise of SNR below
10 dB. This showcases Whisper’s robustness to noise, especially under more natural distribution shifts like the pub
noise.
3.8. Long-form Transcription
Whisper models are trained on 30-second audio chunks and
cannot consume longer audio inputs at once. This is not a
problem with most academic datasets comprised of short
utterances but presents challenges in real-world applications
which often require transcribing minutes- or hours-long audio. We developed a strategy to perform buffered transcription of long audio by consecutively transcribing 30-second
segments of audio and shifting the window according to the
timestamps predicted by the model. We observed that it
is crucial to have beam search and temperature scheduling
based on the repetitiveness and the log probability of the
model predictions in order to reliably transcribe long audio.
The full procedure is described in Section 4.5.
We evaluate the long-form transcription performance on
seven datasets consisting of speech recordings of various
lengths and recording conditions, to cover as diverse a data
distribution as possible. These include a long-form adaptation of TED-LIUM3 (Hernandez et al., 2018) concatenated
so that each example is a full-length TED talk, a collection
of jargon-laden segments taken from The Late Show with
Stephen Colbert (Meanwhile), sets of videos/podcasts that
has been used as ASR benchmarks in online blogs (Rev16
and Kincaid46), recordings of earnings calls (Del Rio et al.,
2021), and the full-length interviews from the Corpus of
Regional African American Language (CORAAL) (Gunter
et al., 2021). Full details about the long-form datasets can
be found in Appendix A.
We compare the performance with open-source models as
well as 4 commercial ASR services. The results are summarized in Figure 6, showing the distribution of word error
rates from Whisper and the 4 commercial ASR services,

systems as well.

as well as the NVIDIA STT Conformer-CTC Large model
from the NeMo toolkit (Kuchaiev et al., 2019) which performed the best among the open-source models. All commercial ASR services are queried using their default English
transcription settings as of September 1st, 2022, and for
the NVIDIA STT model we used their buffered inference
implementation in the FrameBatchASR class to enable
long-form transcription. The results show that Whisper performs better than the compared models on most datasets,
especially on the Meanwhile dataset which is heavy with
uncommon words. Additionally, we note the possibility that
some of the commercial ASR systems have been trained
on some of these publicly available datasets, and therefore
these results may not be accurately reflecting the relative
robustness of the systems.
3.9. Comparison with Human Performance
Because of ambiguous or indistinct speech as well as labeling errors, there are different levels of irreducible error
in each dataset, and with WER metrics from ASR systems
alone it is difficult to make sense of how much room for
improvement exists in each dataset. To quantify how close
Whisper’s performance is to the human performance, we selected 25 recordings from the Kincaid46 dataset and used 5
services to obtain transcripts produced by professional transcribers, among which one provides computer-assisted transcription and the other four are entirely human-transcribed.
The audio selection covers various recording conditions
such as scripted and unscripted broadcast, telephone and
VoIP calls, and meetings. Figure 7 shows the distribution
of per-example WERs and aggregate WER across the 25
recordings, where the computer-assisted service has the
lowest aggregate WER that is 1.15% point better than Whisper’s, and the pure-human performance is only a fraction
of a percentage point better than Whisper’s. These results
indicate that Whisper’s English ASR performance is not
perfect but very close to human-level accuracy.
4. Analysis and Ablations
4.1. Model Scaling
A large amount of the promise in weakly supervised training approaches is their potential to use datasets much larger
than those in traditional supervised learning. However, this
comes with the cost of using data that is possibly much
noisier and lower quality than gold-standard supervision.
A concern with this approach is that although it may look
promising to begin with, the performance of models trained
on this kind of data may saturate at the inherent quality level
of the dataset, which could be far below human level. A related concern is that as capacity and compute spent training
on the dataset increases, models may learn to exploit the

idiosyncrasies of the dataset, and their ability to generalize
robustly to out-of-distribution data could even degrade.
To check whether this is the case, we study the zero-shot
generalization of Whisper models as a function of the model
size. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 8. With the
exception of English speech recognition, performance continues to increase with model size across multilingual speech
recognition, speech translation, and language identification.
The diminishing returns for English speech recognition
could be due to saturation effects from approaching humanlevel performance as analysis in Section 3.9 suggests.
4.2. Dataset Scaling
At 680,000 hours of labeled audio, the Whisper dataset is
one of the largest ever created in supervised speech recognition. Exactly how important is the raw dataset size to
Whisper’s performance? To study this, we trained a series
of medium-sized models on subsampled versions of the
dataset which are 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4%, and 8% of the full
dataset size and compared their performance with the same
medium-sized model trained on the whole dataset. Early
stopping based on the validation loss was used to select
model checkpoints for each dataset size. Evaluation was
performed on an exponential moving average estimate of
the parameters (Polyak & Juditsky, 1992) using a smoothing rate of 0.9999 to help reduce the effect of the learning
rate not fully decaying to zero for the models trained on the
subsampled datasets due to early stopping. Performance
on English and multilingual speech recognition and X→en
translation is reported in Table 6.

English speech recognition performance refers to an average over

X→en translation reports average BLEU on CoVoST2. Dataset
size reported in hours.
All increases in the dataset size result in improved performance on all tasks, although we see significant variability
in improvement rates across tasks and sizes. Performance
improves rapidly on English speech recognition from 3,000
to 13,000 hours and then slows down noticeably between
13,000 and 54,000 hours. Using the full dataset, which corresponds to another 12.5× increase in size results in only a
further 1 point drop in WER. This mirrors the diminishing
returns observed with model size scaling for English speech
recognition and could similarly be explained by saturation
effects when approaching human-level performance.
Improvements in WER follow a power-law trend for multilingual speech recognition till 54,000 hours and then deviate from this trend, improving only a further 7 points
when increasing to the full dataset size. For X→en translation, performance is practically zero when training on 7,000
hours of audio or less, and then follows a roughly log-linear
improvement trend till 54,000 hours before also showing
diminishing returns when further scaling to the full dataset
size.
The general trend across tasks of diminishing returns when
moving from 54,000 hours to our full dataset size of 680,000
hours could suggest that the current best Whisper models are
under-trained relative to dataset size and performance could
be further improved by a combination of longer training
and larger models. It could also suggest that we are nearing
the end of performance improvements from dataset size
scaling for speech recognition. Further analysis is needed to
characterize “scaling laws” for speech recognition in order
to decided between these explanations.
4.3. Multitask and Multilingual Transfer
A potential concern with jointly training a single model
on many tasks and languages is the possibility of negative
transfer where interference between the learning of several
tasks results in performance worse than would be achieved
by training on only a single task or language. To investigate
whether this is occurring, we compared the performance
of models trained on just English speech recognition with
our standard multitask and multilingual training setup and
measured their average performance across our suite of zeroshot English speech recognition benchmarks. We adjust for
the amount of FLOPs spent training on the task of English
speech recognition as only 65% of compute is spent on this
task in a joint training setup; analysis would otherwise be
confounded by under-training on the task when compared
to a same-sized English-only model.
Our results visualized in Figure 9 show that for small models
trained with moderate amounts of compute, there is indeed
negative transfer between tasks and languages: joint models underperform English-only models trained for the same
amount of compute. However, multitask and multilingual

models scale better and for our largest experiments outperform their English-only counterparts demonstrating positive
transfer from other tasks. For our largest experiments, joint
models also slightly outperform English-only models even
when not adjusting for compute spent per task.
4.4. Text Normalization
Since we developed our text normalization jointly with
Whisper to discount innocuous word errors, there is a risk
that our normalizer is overfitted to fixing Whisper’s peculiarities rather than addressing general variation in transcription.
To check this, we compared the performance of Whisper
using our normalizer versus an independently developed
one from the FairSpeech project (Koenecke et al., 2020). In
Figure 10, we visualize the differences. On most datasets
the two normalizers perform similarly, without significant
differences in WER reduction between Whisper and compared open-source models, while on some datasets, namely
WSJ, CallHome, and Switchboard, our normalizer reduces
the WER of Whisper models’ significantly more. The differences in reduction can be traced down to different formats
used by the ground truth and how the two normalizers are penalizing them. For example, in CallHome and Switchboard,
our standardizer did not penalize differences in common
English contractions such as “you’re” versus “you are”, and
in WSJ, our normalizer standardized the written and spo50 40 30 20 10 0

and Switchboard which have many contractions in the ground truth
and WSJ which contains many numerical expressions.

“sixty-eight million dollars” versus “$68 million”.
4.5. Strategies for Reliable Long-form Transcription
Transcribing long-form audio using Whisper relies on accurate prediction of the timestamp tokens to determine the
amount to shift the model’s 30-second audio context window by, and inaccurate transcription in one window may
negatively impact transcription in the subsequent windows.
We have developed a set of heuristics that help avoid failure cases of long-form transcription, which is applied in
the results reported in sections 3.8 and 3.9. First, we use
beam search with 5 beams using the log probability as the
score function, to reduce repetition looping which happens
more frequently in greedy decoding. We start with temperature 0, i.e. always selecting the tokens with the highest probability, and increase the temperature by 0.2 up to
1.0 when either the average log probability over the generated tokens is lower than −1 or the generated text has a
gzip compression rate higher than 2.4. Providing the transcribed text from the preceding window as previous-text
conditioning when the applied temperature is below 0.5
further improves the performance. We found that the probability of the <|nospeech|> token alone is not sufficient

to distinguish a segment with no speech, but combining
the no-speech probability threshold of 0.6 and the average
log-probability threshold of −1 makes the voice activity
detection of Whisper more reliable. Finally, to avoid a failure mode where the model ignores the first few words in
the input, we constrained the initial timestamp token to be
between 0.0 and 1.0 second. Table 7 shows that adding each
of the interventions above incrementally reduces the WER
overall, but not evenly across the dataset. These heuristics
serve as a workaround for the noisy predictions of the model,
and more research would be needed to further improve the
reliability of long-form decoding.
5. Related Work
Scaling Speech Recognition A consistent theme across
speech recognition research has been documenting the benefits of scaling compute, models, and datasets. Early work applying deep learning to speech recognition found improved
performance with model depth and size and leveraged GPU
acceleration to make training these larger models tractable
(Mohamed et al., 2009). Further research demonstrated that
the benefit of deep learning approaches to speech recognition increased with dataset size, improving from being only
competitive with prior GMM-HMM systems when using
just 3 hours of TIMIT training data for phone recognition
to achieving a 30% word error rate reduction when trained
on the 2,000 hour Switchboard dataset (Seide et al., 2011).
Liao et al. (2013) is an early example of leveraging weakly
supervised learning to increase the size of a deep learning based speech recognition dataset by over 1,000 hours.
These trends continued with Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al.,
2015) being a notable system developing high-throughput
distributed training across 16 GPUs and scaling to 12,000
hours of training data while demonstrating continuing improvements at that scale. By leveraging semi-supervised
pre-training, Narayanan et al. (2018) were able to grow
dataset size much further and study training on 162,000
hours of labeled audio. More recent work has explored
billion-parameter models (Zhang et al., 2020) and using up
to 1,000,000 hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021).
Multitask Learning Multitask learning (Caruana, 1997)
has been studied for a long time. In speech recognition,
multi-lingual models have been explored for well over a
decade (Schultz & Kirchhoff, 2006). An inspirational and
foundational work in NLP exploring multi-task learning
with a single model is Collobert et al. (2011). Multitask
learning in the sequence-to-sequence framework (Sutskever
et al., 2014) using multiple encoders and decoders was investigated in Luong et al. (2015). The use of language codes
with a shared encoder/decoder architecture was first demonstrated for machine translation by Johnson et al. (2017),
removing the need for separate encoders and decoders. This
approach was simplified further into the “text-to-text” framework of McCann et al. (2018) and popularized by its success
with large transformer language models in the work of Radford et al. (2019) and Raffel et al. (2020). Toshniwal et al.
(2018) demonstrated jointly training a modern deep learning speech recognition system on several languages with a
single model, and Pratap et al. (2020a) scaled this line of
work significantly to 50 languages with a billion-parameter
model. MUTE (Wang et al., 2020c) and mSLAM (Bapna
et al., 2022) studied joint training over both text and speech
language tasks, demonstrating transfer between them.
Robustness The question of how effectively models transfer and how robust they are to distribution shift and other
types of perturbations has long been studied and is actively
being researched across many fields of machine learning.
Torralba & Efros (2011) highlighted the lack of generalization of machine learning models between datasets over a
decade ago. Many other works have shown and continually reiterated how despite high performance on IID test
sets, machine learning models can still make many mistakes
when evaluated in even slightly different settings (Lake et al.,
2017; Jia & Liang, 2017; Alcorn et al., 2019; Barbu et al.,
2019; Recht et al., 2019). More recently, Taori et al. (2020)
studied the robustness of image classification models, and
Miller et al. (2020) investigated this for question-answering
models. A key finding has been that multi-domain training increases robustness and generalization as discussed in
the Introduction. This finding has been replicated across
many fields in addition to speech recognition including NLP
(Hendrycks et al., 2020) and computer vision (Radford et al.,
2021).
6. Limitations and Future Work
From our experimental results, analyses, and ablations, we
have noted several limitations and areas for future work.
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 14
Improved decoding strategies. As we have scaled Whisper, we have observed that larger models have made steady
and reliable progress on reducing perception-related errors
such as confusing similar-sounding words. Many remaining
errors, particularly in long-form transcription seem more
stubborn in nature and decidedly non-human/perceptual.
They are a combination of failure modes of seq2seq models, language models, and text-audio alignment and include
problems such as getting stuck in repeat loops, not transcribing the first or last few words of an audio segment, or
complete hallucination where the model will output a transcript entirely unrelated to the actual audio. Although the
decoding details discussed in Section 4.5 help significantly,
we suspect fine-tuning Whisper models on a high-quality
supervised dataset and/or using reinforcement learning to
more directly optimize for decoding performance could help
further reduce these errors.
Increase Training Data For Lower-Resource Languages
As Figure 3 shows, Whisper’s speech recognition performance is still quite poor on many languages. The same
analysis suggests a clear route for improvement since performance on a language is very well predicted by the amount
of training data for the language. Since our pre-training
dataset is currently very English-heavy due to biases of
our data collection pipeline, which sourced primarily from
English-centric parts of the internet, most languages have
less than 1000 hours of training data. A targeted effort at increasing the amount of data for these rarer languages could
result in a large improvement to average speech recognition
performance even with only a small increase in our overall
training dataset size.
Studying fine-tuning In this work, we have focused on
the robustness properties of speech processing systems and
as a result only studied the zero-shot transfer performance
of Whisper. While this is a crucial setting to study due to it
being representative of general reliability, for many domains
where high-quality supervised speech data does exist, it is
likely that results can be improved further by fine-tuning.
An additional benefit of studying fine-tuning is that it allows
for direct comparisons with prior work since it is a much
more common evaluation setting.
Studying the impact of Language Models on Robustness
As argued in the introduction, we suspect that Whisper’s
robustness is partially due to its strong decoder, which is an
audio conditional language model. It’s currently unclear to
what degree the benefits of Whisper stem from training its
encoder, decoder, or both. This could be studied by either
ablating various design components of Whisper, such as
training a decoder-less CTC model, or by studying how the
performance of existing speech recognition encoders such
as wav2vec 2.0 change when used together with a language
model.
Adding Auxiliary Training Objectives Whisper departs
noticeably from most recent state-of-the-art speech recognition systems due to the lack of unsupervised pre-training
or self-teaching methods. While we have not found them
necessary to achieve good performance, it is possible that
the results could be further improved by incorporating this.
7. Conclusion
Whisper suggests that scaling weakly supervised pretraining has been underappreciated so far in speech recognition research. We achieve our results without the need for
the self-supervision and self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work and demonstrate how simply training on a large and
diverse supervised dataset and focusing on zero-shot transfer can significantly improve the robustness of a speech
recognition system.

Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 19
A. Evaluation Datasets.
A.1. Short-form English-only datasets
• LibriSpeech (Panayotov et al., 2015): We used the test-clean and test-other splits from the LibriSpeech ASR corpus.
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the test split of TED-LIUM Release 3, using the segmented manual
transcripts included in the release.
• Common Voice 5.1 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the English subset of Common Voice Corpus 5.1 from the
official website.
• Artie bias corpus (Meyer et al., 2020): We used the Artie bias corpus. This is a subset of the Common Voice dataset.
• CallHome and Switchboard: We used the two corpora from LDC2002S09 and LDC2002T43.
• WSJ: We used LDC93S6B and LDC94S13B and followed the s5 recipe to preprocess the dataset.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 interviews from CORAAL (Kendall & Farrington, 2021) and used the preprocessing
script from the FairSpeech project.
• CHiME-6: For CHiME-6 (Watanabe et al., 2020), we downloaded the CHiME-5 dataset and followed the stage 0
of the s5 track1 recipe to create the CHiME-6 dataset which fixes synchronization. We then used the binaural
recordings (* P??.wav) and the corresponding transcripts.
• AMI-IHM and AMI-SDM1: We preprocessed the AMI Corpus by following the stage 0 ad 2 of the s5b recipe.
A.2. Long-form English-only datasets
• TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018): We used the 11 full-length TED talks from the test split of TED-LIUM
Release 3, slicing the source audio files between the beginning of the first labeled segment and the end of the last
labeled segment of each talk, and we used the concatenated text as the label.
• Meanwhile: This dataset consists of 64 segments from The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The YouTube video ID
and the corresponding start and end timestamps are available as part of the code release. The labels are collected from
the closed-caption data for each video and corrected with manual inspection.
• Rev16: We use a subset of 16 files from the 30 podcast episodes in Rev.AI’s Podcast Transcription Benchmark, after
finding that there are multiple cases where a significant portion of the audio and the labels did not match, mostly on the
parts introducing the sponsors. We selected 16 episodes that do not have this error, whose “file number”s are:
3 4 9 10 11 14 17 18 20 21 23 24 26 27 29 32
• Kincaid46: This dataset consists of 46 audio files and the corresponding transcripts compiled in the blog article ¡Which
automatic transcription service is the most accurate - 2018¿ by Jason Kincaid. We used the 46 audio files and reference
transcripts from the Airtable widget in the article. For the human transcription benchmark in the paper, we use a subset
of 25 examples from this data, whose “Ref ID”s are:
2 4 5 8 9 10 12 13 14 16 19 21 23 25 26 28 29 30 33 35 36 37 42 43 45
• Earnings-21 (Del Rio et al., 2021) and Earnings-22: We used the files available in the speech-datasets repository, as
of their 202206 version.
• CORAAL: We used the 231 full-length interviews and transcripts from (Kendall & Farrington, 2021).
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 20
A.3. Multilingual datasets
• Multilingual LibriSpeech (Pratap et al., 2020b): We used the test splits from each language in the Multilingual
LibriSpeech (MLS) corpus.
• Fleurs (Conneau et al., 2022): We collected audio files and transcripts using the implementation available as HuggingFace datasets. To use as a translation dataset, we matched the numerical utterance IDs to find the corresponding
transcript in English.
• VoxPopuli (Wang et al., 2021): We used the get asr data.py script from the official repository to collect the ASR
data in 16 languages, including English.
• Common Voice 9 (Ardila et al., 2019): We downloaded the Common Voice Corpus 9 from the official website.
• CoVOST 2 (Wang et al., 2020b): We collected the X into English data collected using the official repository.
B. Compared Models
For comparison, we use the following models from HuggingFace, downloaded as of September 2022 using version 4.21.0 of
the transformers library:
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h-lv60-self (Xu et al., 2021)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-robust-ft-libri-960h (Hsu et al., 2021b)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-100h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/wav2vec2-large-960h (Baevski et al., 2020)
• facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/hubert-xlarge-ls960-ft (Hsu et al., 2021a)
• facebook/s2t-medium-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• facebook/s2t-large-librispeech-asr (Wang et al., 2020a)
• microsoft/unispeech-sat-base-100h-libri-ft (Chen et al., 2022a)
• nvidia/stt en conformer ctc large (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• nvidia/stt en conformer transducer xlarge (Kuchaiev et al., 2019)
• speechbrain/asr-crdnn-rnnlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
• speechbrain/asr-transformer-transformerlm-librispeech (Ravanelli et al., 2021)
We note that all of the models above are entirely or partly trained on LibriSpeech.

C. Text Standardization
Since Whisper may output any UTF-8 string rather than a restricted set of graphemes, the rules for text standardization need
to be more intricate and comprehensive than those defined on e.g. ASCII characters. We perform the following steps to
normalize English texts in different styles into a standardized form, which is a best-effort attempt to penalize only when a
word error is caused by actually mistranscribing a word, and not by formatting or punctuation differences.
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Remove any of the following words: hmm, mm, mhm, mmm, uh, um
4. Remove whitespace characters that comes before an apostrophe ’
5. Convert standard or informal contracted forms of English into the original form.
6. Remove commas (,) between digits
7. Remove periods (.) not followed by numbers
8. Remove symbols as well as diacritics from the text, where symbols are the characters with the Unicode category
starting with M, S, or P, except period, percent, and currency symbols that may be detected in the next step.
9. Detect any numeric expressions of numbers and currencies and replace with a form using Arabic numbers, e.g. “Ten
thousand dollars” → “$10000”.
10. Convert British spellings into American spellings.
11. Remove remaining symbols that are not part of any numeric expressions.
12. Replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
A different, language-specific set of transformations would be needed to equivalently normalize non-English text, but due to
our lack of linguistic knowledge to build such normalizers for all languages, we resort to the following basic standardization
for non-English text:
1. Remove any phrases between matching brackets ([, ]).
2. Remove any phrases between matching parentheses ((, )).
3. Replace any markers, symbols, and punctuation characters with a space, i.e. when the Unicode category of each
character in the NFKC-normalized string starts with M, S, or P.
4. make the text lowercase.
5. replace any successive whitespace characters with a space.
Additionally, we put a space between every letter for the languages that do not use spaces to separate words, namely Chinese,
Japanese, Thai, Lao, and Burmese, effectively measuring the character error rate instead.
We note that the above is an imperfect solution, and it will sometimes produce unintended and unexpected outputs. We do
not claim that the text format resulting from the above is more “correct” in any measure. Rather, the procedures above are
designed to better distinguish between innocuous differences in wording and genuine mistranscriptions. Python code for
the standardization procedures above is available as part of our code and model release to facilitate future iterations and
improvements on text standardization.

 standard benchmarks and are often competitive
with prior fully supervised results but in a zeroshot transfer setting without the need for any finetuning. When compared to humans, the models
approach their accuracy and robustness. We are
releasing models and inference code to serve as
a foundation for further work on robust speech
processing.
1. Introduction
Progress in speech recognition has been energized by the
development of unsupervised pre-training techniques exemplified by Wav2Vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020). Since these
methods learn directly from raw audio without the need for
human labels, they can productively use large datasets of unlabeled speech and have been quickly scaled up to 1,000,000
hours of training data (Zhang et al., 2021), far more than the
1,000 or so hours typical of an academic supervised dataset.
When fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, this approach
has improved the state of the art, especially in a low-data
setting.
These pre-trained audio encoders learn high-quality representations of speech, but because they are purely unsupervised they lack an equivalently performant decoder mapping
those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a finetuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as
speech recognition1
. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex
process requiring a skilled practitioner. There is an additional risk with requiring fine-tuning. Machine learning

1Baevski et al. (2021) is an exciting exception - having developed a fully unsupervised speech recognition system
methods are exceedingly adept at finding patterns within a
training dataset which boost performance on held-out data
from the same dataset. However, some of these patterns are
brittle and spurious and don’t generalize to other datasets
and distributions. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object
classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision
model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015)
without observing any improvement in average accuracy
when classifying the same objects on seven other natural
image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many
basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely
because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that
humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020).
This suggests that while unsupervised pre-training has improved the quality of audio encoders dramatically, the lack
of an equivalently high-quality pre-trained decoder, combined with a recommended protocol of dataset-specific finetuning, is a crucial weakness which limits their usefulness
and robustness. The goal of a speech recognition system
should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range
of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of
a decoder for every deployment distribution.
As demonstrated by Narayanan et al. (2018), Likhomanenko
et al. (2020), and Chan et al. (2021) speech recognition systems that are pre-trained in a supervised fashion across many
datasets/domains exhibit higher robustness and generalize
much more effectively to held-out datasets than models
trained on a single source. These works achieve this by
combining as many existing high-quality speech recognition datasets as possible. However, there is still only a
moderate amount of this data easily available. SpeechStew
(Chan et al., 2021) mixes together 7 pre-existing datasets
totalling 5,140 hours of supervision. While not insignificant, this is still tiny compared to the previously mentioned
1,000,000 hours of unlabeled speech data utilized in Zhang
et al. (2021).
Recognizing the limiting size of existing high-quality supervised datasets, recent efforts have created larger datasets for
speech recognition. By relaxing the requirement of goldstandard human-validated transcripts, Chen et al. (2021) and
Galvez et al. (2021) make use of sophisticated automated
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 2
pipelines to scale weakly supervised speech recognition
to 10,000 and 30,000 hours of noisier training data. This
trade-off between quality and quantity is often the right
call. Although understudied so far for speech recognition,
recent work in computer vision has demonstrated that moving beyond gold-standard crowdsourced datasets such as
ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) to much larger but
weakly supervised datasets significantly improves the robustness and generalization of models (Mahajan et al., 2018;
Kolesnikov et al., 2020).
Yet these new datasets are only a few times larger than the
sum of existing high-quality datasets and still much smaller
than prior unsupervised work. In this work we close that
gap, scaling weakly supervised speech recognition the next
order of magnitude to 680,000 hours of labeled audio data.
We call our approach Whisper2
. We demonstrate models
trained at this scale transfer well to existing datasets zeroshot, removing the need for any dataset-specific fine-tuning
to achieve high-quality results.
In addition to scale, our work also focuses on broadening the scope of weakly supervised pre-training beyond
English-only speech recognition to be both multilingual and
multitask. Of those 680,000 hours of audio, 117,000 hours
cover 96 other languages. The dataset also includes 125,000
hours of X→en translation data. We find that for sufficiently
large models there is no drawback and even benefits to joint
multilingual and multitask training.
Our work suggests that simple scaling of weakly supervised
pre-training has been underappreciated so far for speech
recognition. We achieve these results without the need for
the self-supervision or self-training techniques that have
been a mainstay of recent large-scale speech recognition
work. To serve as a foundation for further research on robust
speech recognition, we release inference code and models at
the following URL: https://github.com/openai/
whisper.
2. Approach
2.1. Data Processing
Following the trend of recent work leveraging web-scale
text from the internet for training machine learning systems,
we take a minimalist approach to data pre-processing. In
contrast to a lot of work on speech recognition, we train
Whisper models to predict the raw text of transcripts without
any significant standardization, relying on the expressiveness of sequence-to-sequence models to learn to map between utterances and their transcribed form. This simplifies
2
If an acronym or basis for the name is desired, WSPSR standing for Web-scale Supervised Pretraining for Speech Recognition
can be used.
the speech recognition pipeline since it removes the need
for a separate inverse text normalization step in order to
produce naturalistic transcriptions.
We construct the dataset from audio that is paired with transcripts on the Internet. This results in a very diverse dataset
covering a broad distribution of audio from many different
environments, recording setups, speakers, and languages.
While diversity in audio quality can help train a model to be
robust, diversity in transcript quality is not similarly beneficial. Initial inspection showed a large amount of subpar
transcripts in the raw dataset. To address this, we developed
several automated filtering methods to improve transcript
quality.
Many transcripts on the internet are not actually humangenerated but the output of existing ASR systems. Recent
research has shown that training on datasets of mixed human
and machine-generated data can significantly impair the performance of translation systems (Ghorbani et al., 2021). In
order to avoid learning “transcript-ese”, we developed many
heuristics to detect and remove machine-generated transcripts from the training dataset. Many existing ASR systems output only a limited subset of written language which
removes or normalizes away aspects that are difficult to predict from only audio signals such as complex punctuation
(exclamation points, commas, and question marks), formatting whitespace such as paragraphs, or stylistic aspects such
as capitalization. An all-uppercase or all-lowercase transcript is very unlikely to be human generated. While many
ASR systems include some level of inverse text normalization, it is often simple or rule-based and still detectable from
other unhandled aspects such as never including commas.
We also use an audio language detector, which was created
by fine-tuning a prototype model trained on a prototype version of the dataset on VoxLingua107 (Valk & Alumae¨ , 2021)
to ensure that the spoken language matches the language of
the transcript according to CLD2. If the two do not match,
we don’t include the (audio, transcript) pair as a speech
recognition training example in the dataset. We make an
exception if the transcript language is English and add these
pairs to the dataset as X→en speech translation training
examples instead. We use fuzzy de-duping of transcript
texts to reduce the amount of duplication and automatically
generated content in the training dataset.
We break audio files into 30-second segments paired with
the subset of the transcript that occurs within that time
segment. We train on all audio, including segments where
there is no speech (though with sub-sampled probability)
and use these segments as training data for voice activity
detection.
For an additional filtering pass, after training an initial model
we aggregated information about its error rate on training
Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision 3
data sources and performed manual inspection of these data
sources sorting by a combination of both high error rate and
data source size in order to identify and remove low-quality
ones efficiently. This inspection showed a large amount of
only partially transcribed or poorly aligned/misaligned transcripts as well as remaining low-quality machine-generated
captions that filtering heuristics did not detect.
To avoid contamination, we perform de-duplication at a transcript level between the training dataset and the evaluation
datasets we thought were at higher risk of overlap, namely
TED-LIUM 3 (Hernandez et al., 2018).
2.2. Model
Since the focus of our work is on studying the capabilities
of large-scale supervised pre-training for speech recognition, we use an off-the-shelf architecture to avoid confounding our findings with model improvements. We chose an
encoder-decoder Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as this
architecture has been well validated to scale reliably. All
audio is re-sampled to 16,000 Hz, and an 80-channel logmagnitude Mel spectrogram representation is computed on
25-millisecond windows with a stride of 10 milliseconds.
For feature normalization, we globally scale the input to
be between -1 and 1 with approximately zero mean across
the pre-training dataset. The encoder processes this input
representation with a small stem consisting of two convolution layers with a filter width of 3 and the GELU activation
function (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) where the second
convolution layer has a stride of two. Sinusoidal position
embeddings are then added to the output of the stem after
which the encoder Transformer blocks are applied. The
transformer uses pre-activation residual blocks (Child et al.,
2019), and a final layer normalization is applied to the encoder output. The decoder uses learned position embeddings
and tied input-output token representations (Press & Wolf,
2017). The encoder and decoder have the same width and
number of transformer blocks. Figure 1 summarizes the
model architecture.
We use the same byte-level BPE text tokenizer used in GPT2 (Sennrich et al., 2015; Radford et al., 2019) for the Englishonly models and refit the vocabulary (but keep the same size)
for the multilingual models to avoid excessive fragmentation on other languages since the GPT-2 BPE vocabulary is
English only.
2.3. Multitask Format
Although predicting which words were spoken in a given
audio snippet is a core part of the full speech recognition
problem and extensively studied in research, it is not the
only part. A fully featured speech recognition system can
involve many additional components such as voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and inverse text normalization. These components are often handled separately,
resulting in a relatively complex system around the core
speech recognition model. To reduce this complexity, we
would like to have a single model perform the entire speech
processing pipeline, not just the core recognition part. An
important consideration here is the interface for the model.
There are many different tasks that can be performed on
the same input audio signal: transcription, translation, voice
activity detection, alignment, and language identification
are some examples.
For this kind of one-to-many mapping to work with a single
model, some form of task specification is necessary. We use
a simple format to specify all tasks and conditioning information as a sequence of input tokens to the decoder. Since
our decoder is an audio-conditional language model, we also
train it to condition on the history of text of the transcript in
the hope that it will learn to use longer-range text context
to resolve ambiguous audio. Specifically, with some probability we add the transcript text preceding the current audio
segment to the decoder’s context. We indicate the beginning
of prediction with a <|startoftranscript|> token.
First, we predict the language being spoken which is represented by a unique token for each language in our training
set (99 total). These language targets are sourced from the
aforementioned VoxLingua107 model. In the case where
there is no speech in an audio segment, the model is trained
to predict a <|nospeech|> token indicating this. The
next token specifies the task (either transcription or translation) with an <|transcribe|> or <|translate|>
token. After this, we specify whether to predict timestamps
or not by including a <|notimestamps|> token for that
case. At this point, the task and desired format is fully
specified, and the output begins. For timestamp prediction, we predict time relative to the current audio segment,
quantizing all times to the nearest 20 milliseconds which
matches the native time resolution of Whisper models, and
add additional tokens to our vocabulary for each of these.
We interleave their prediction with the caption tokens: the
start time token is predicted before each caption’s text, and
the end time token is predicted after. When a final transcript segment is only partially included in the current 30-
second audio chunk, we predict only its start time token
for the segment when in timestamp mode, to indicate that
the subsequent decoding should be performed on an audio window aligned with that time, otherwise we truncate
the audio to not include the segment. Lastly, we add a
<|endoftranscript|> token. We only mask out the
training loss over the previous context text, and train the
model to predict all other tokens. Please see Figure 1 for an
overview of our format and training setup.

Figure 1. Overview of our approach. A sequence-to-sequence Transformer model is trained on many different speech processing tasks,
including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these
tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different
stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or
classification targets, as further explained in Section 2.3.
2.4. Training Details
We train a suite of models of various sizes in order to study
the scaling properties of Whisper. Please see Table 1 for an
overview. We train with data parallelism across accelerators
using FP16 with dynamic loss scaling and activation checkpointing (Griewank & Walther, 2000; Chen et al., 2016).
Models were trained with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter,
2017) and gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al., 2013)
with a linear learning rate decay to zero after a warmup over
the first 2048 updates. A batch size of 256 segments was
used, and the models are trained for 220 updates which is
between two and three passes over the dataset. Due to only
training for a few epochs, over-fitting is not a large concern,
and we do not use any data augmentation or regularization
and instead rely on the diversity contained within such a
large dataset to encourage generalization and robustness.
Please see Appendix F for full training hyperparameters.3
During early development and evaluation we observed that
Whisper models had a tendency to transcribe plausible but
almost always incorrect guesses for the names of speakers.
This happens because many transcripts in the pre-training
dataset include the name of the person who is speaking,
encouraging the model to try to predict them, but this information is only rarely inferable from only the most recent 30
3After the original release of Whisper, we trained an additional
Large model (denoted V2) for 2.5X more epochs while adding
SpecAugment (Park et al., 2019), Stochastic Depth (Huang et al.,
2016), and BPE Dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) for regularization.
Reported results have been updated to this improved model unless
otherwise specified.

seconds of audio context. To avoid this, we fine-tune Whisper models briefly on the subset of transcripts that do not
include speaker annotations which removes this behavior.
3. Experiments
3.1. Zero-shot Evaluation
The goal of Whisper is to develop a single robust speech
processing system that works reliably without the need for
dataset specific fine-tuning to achieve high-quality results
on specific distributions. To study this capability, we reuse a wide set of existing speech processing datasets to
check whether Whisper is able to generalize well across
domains, tasks, and languages. Instead of using the standard
evaluation protocol for these datasets, which include both
a train and test split, we evaluate Whisper in a zero-shot
setting without using any of the training data for each of
these datasets so that we are measuring broad generalization.
3.2. Evaluation Metrics
Speech recognition research typically evaluates and compares systems based on the word error rate (WER) metric.
However, WER, which is based on string edit distance, penalizes all differences between the model’s output and the
reference transcript including innocuous differences in transcript style. As a result, systems that output transcripts that
would be judged as correct by humans can still have a large
WER due to minor formatting differences. While this poses
a problem for all transcribers, it is particularly acute for
zero-shot models like Whisper, which do not observe any
examples of specific datasets transcript formats.
This is not a novel observation; the development of evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgement is an
active area of research, and while there are some promising
methods, none have seen widespread adoption for speech
recognition yet. We opt to address this problem with extensive standardization of text before the WER calculation
to minimize penalization of non-semantic differences. Our
text normalizer was developed through iterative manual inspection to identify common patterns where naive WER
penalized Whisper models for an innocuous difference. Appendix C includes full details. For several datasets, we
observe WER drops of up to 50 percent usually due to a
quirk such as a dataset’s reference transcripts seperating
contractions from words with whitespace. We caution this
development procedure comes at a risk of overfitting to the
transcription style of Whisper models which we investigate
in Section 4.4. We are releasing the code for our text normalizer to allow for easy comparison and to help others
study the performance of speech recognition systems in
out-of-distribution settings.
3.3. English Speech Recognition
In 2015, Deep Speech 2 (Amodei et al., 2015) reported
a speech recognition system matched human-level performance when transcribing the LibriSpeech test-clean split.
As part of their analysis they concluded: “Given this result,
we suspect that there is little room for a generic speech system to further improve on clean read speech without further
domain adaptation.” Yet seven years later the SOTA WER
on LibriSpeech test-clean has dropped another 73% from
their 5.3% to 1.4% (Zhang et al., 2021), far below their reported human-level error rate of 5.8%. Despite this massive
and unanticipated further improvement in performance on
held-out but in-distribution data, speech recognition models trained on LibriSpeech remain far above human error
rates when used in other settings. What explains this gap
between reportedly superhuman performance in-distribution
and subhuman performance out-of-distribution?
We suspect a large part of this gap between human and
machine behavior is due to conflating different capabilities
being measured by human and machine performance on
a test set. This claim may seem confusing at first; if both
humans and machines are taking the same test, how can it be
that different skills are being tested? The difference arises
not in the testing but in how they trained for it. Humans are
often asked to perform a task given little to no supervision
on the specific data distribution being studied. Thus human
performance is a measure of out-of-distribution generalization. But machine learning models are usually evaluated
after training on a large amount of supervision from the
evaluation distribution, meaning that machine performance
is instead a measure of in-distribution generalization. While
both humans and machines are being evaluated on the same
test data, two quite different abilities are being measured
due to a difference in train data.
Whisper models, which are trained on a broad and diverse
distribution of audio and evaluated in a zero-shot setting,
could potentially match human behavior much better than
existing systems. To study whether this is the case (or
whether the difference between machine and human performance is due to yet-to-be-understood factors) we can
compare Whisper models with both human performance
and standard fine-tuned machine learning models and check
which they more closely match.

their brittleness and lack of robustness. The estimated robustness
frontier of zero-shot Whisper models, however, includes the 95%
confidence interval for this particular human.
To quantify this difference, we examine both overall robustness, that is average performance across many distributions/datasets, and effective robustness, introduced by Taori
et al. (2020), which measures the difference in expected
performance between a reference dataset, which is usually
in-distribution, and one or more out-of-distribution datasets.
A model with high effective robustness does better than
expected on out-of-distribution datasets as a function of its
performance on the
